# Guessing-Number-Efficiency-Test
This is a very small project that researches on the efficiency of the methods in the number guessing game.(1~100)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-2.py --> very much like binary search  
1-3.py --> a one-third search?  
1-4.py --> a one-forth search  
Random.py --> like its name. It's random.  
Hybrid.py --> It's guessing 50 at the first time, and then do 1-3. For example: 50, 16, 38......

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to try the fibonacci search which goes by: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13......I have only learnt the fibonacci search after this small project and will test it out when I have time.
