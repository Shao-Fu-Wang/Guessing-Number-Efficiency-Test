# Guessing-Number-Efficiency-Test
This is a very small project that researches on the efficiency of the methods in the number guessing game.(1~100)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-2.py --> very much like binary search
1-3.py --> a one-third search?
1-4.py --> a one-forth search
Random.py --> like its name. It's random.
Hybrid.py --> It's guessing 50 at the first time, and then do 1-3. For example: 50, 16, 38......
